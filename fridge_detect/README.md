# Fridge Detection Module

This package wraps the Roboflow-based ingredient detector. Use `detect_and_generate()` to analyse a fridge photo, save an annotated image, and emit a `recipe_input.json` payload for the recommender. Demo images and cached detection payloads live in the adjacent `demo/` directory.
